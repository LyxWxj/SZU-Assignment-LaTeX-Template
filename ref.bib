abstract = {Accurately quantifying functional traits across large scales is considered fundamental for the management and conservation of existing mangrove ecosystems. In recent years, hybrid models, which combine radiative transfer model simulations with machine learning regression algorithms (MLRA), have been effectively employed in satellite-based estimations of plant functional traits across diverse ecosystems. Nevertheless, the inevitable data redundancy stemming from heavy-parameterization radiative transfer models restricts the application of the hybrid model. Previous studies have indicated that active learning (AL) strategies can mitigate this redundancy through smart sampling selection criteria. While many studies have attempted to investigate mangrove functional traits using various models, there is limited understanding of the performance of hybrid models coupled with active learning strategies in retrieving the traits. In recent years, Sentinel-2 has become mainstream for retrieving detailed and reliable information across diverse ecosystems. The aim of this study is to utilize a retrieval scheme to extract four mangrove functional traits from Sentinel-2 imagery: leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), leaf dry matter content (Cm), and leaf equivalent water thickness (Cw). In order to achieve this goal, we systematically evaluated 36 different MLRA-AL models, which were combinations of six MLRAs and six AL strategies. Retrieval results showed that GPR (Gaussian processes regression)-ABD (angle-based diversity) and GPR-PAL (variance-based pool of regressors) yielded the highest accuracies for LAI (R2 = 0.68, NRMSE = 10.488 %) and Cw (R2 = 0.47, NRMSE = 13.868 %), respectively. GPR-EBD (Euclidean distance-based diversity) had the highest accuracies of Cm (R2 = 0.54, NRMSE = 11.695 %) and Cab (R2 = 0.71, NRMSE = 13.764 %). The retrieval models were subsequently applied to produce distribution pattern maps of four mangrove functional traits within a Ramsar site. This study represents the first attempt to utilize AL strategies to enhance the efficiency of traditional hybrid models and map multiple functional traits of mangrove forests. The retrieval scheme and mapping results could significantly contribute to the management of mangrove ecosystems and provide a fundamental data source for future research on the ecological services of mangroves.}

abstract={The PROSPECT leaf optical model has, to date, well-separated the effects of total chlorophyll and carotenoids on leaf reflectance and transmittance in the 400--800{\thinspace}nm. Considering variations in chlorophyll a:b ratio with leaf age and physiological stress, a further separation of total plant-based chlorophylls into chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b is necessary for advanced monitoring of plant growth. In this study, we present an extended version of PROSPECT model (hereafter referred to as PROSPECT-MP) that can combine the effects of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids on leaf directional hemispherical reflectance and transmittance (DHR and DHT) in the 400--800{\thinspace}nm. The LOPEX93 dataset was used to evaluate the capabilities of PROSPECT-MP for spectra modelling and pigment retrieval. The results show that PROSPECT-MP can both simultaneously retrieve leaf chlorophyll a and b, and also performs better than PROSPECT-5 in retrieving carotenoids concentrations. As for the simulation of DHR and DHT, the performances of PROSPECT-MP are similar to that of PROSPECT-5. This study demonstrates the potential of PROSPECT-MP for improving capabilities of remote sensing of leaf photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids) and for providing a framework for future refinements in the modelling of leaf optical properties.},

abstract = {Accurate estimation of mangrove leaf area index (LAI) is fundamental for effective mangrove ecosystem management and protection. Remote sensing technology has showed its powerful potential in accurately retrieving mangrove LAI. The generic estimation model combining vegetation indices (VIs) with physically-based law, simplified as LAI-VIs model, has successfully estimated crop LAI. However, the capacity of estimating mangrove LAI using this model, so far, is unclear. Moreover, some studies have proved that estimation accuracy of terrestrial forests and crops LAI can be ameliorated with VIs based on red-edge band (VIs_RE) because of less affecting by canopy structure. However, little literature explores the ability of VIs_RE, especially, from different multispectral sensors, for estimating mangrove LAI. Therefore, our main purpose is to evaluate the robustness and sensitivity of the LAI-VIs_RE model from Sentinel-2, WorldView-2 (WV-2) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery for estimating mangrove LAI. The estimation models with input variables of NDVI, NDVI_RE1 (band combination from red-edge and visible band), NDVI_RE2 (band combination from red-edge and near-infrared reflectance) from three types of multispectral imagery are used to calculate mangrove LAI of 99 plots. The results showed that the WV-2 imagery acquires the best estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.414), followed by Sentinel-2 imagery (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.440), and UAV multispectral imagery (R2 = 0.48, RMSE = 0.570). The analyses display the good results of the LAI-NDVI model and LAI-NDVI_RE1 model from WV-2 and Sentinel-2 imagery with the range of R2 from 0.57 to 0.72, and the discrepant consequences of LAI-NDVI_RE2 model from UAV imagery with R2 of 0.15, WV-2 imagery with R2 of 0.67 and Sentienl-2 imagery with R2 of 0.65, 0.18 and 0.12. This study proves that the generic estimation model and NDVI_RE1 derived from WV-2 and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery could be deemed as a basic method and input variables of mapping mangrove LAI.}

Here we present a new calibration and validation of PROSPECT that separates plant pigment contributions to the visible spectrum using several comprehensive datasets containing hundreds of leaves collected in a wide range of ecosystem types. These data include leaf biochemical (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, water, and dry matter) and optical properties (directional–hemispherical reflectance and transmittance measured from 400 nm to 2450 nm). We first provide distinct in vivo specific absorption coefficients for each biochemical constituent and determine an average refractive index of the leaf interior. Then we invert the model on independent datasets to check the prediction of the biochemical content of intact leaves. The main result of this study is that the new chlorophyll and carotenoid specific absorption coefficients agree well with available in vitro absorption spectra, and that the new refractive index displays interesting spectral features in the visible, in accordance with physical principles. Moreover, we improve the chlorophyll estimation (RMSE=9 µg/cm2) and obtain very encouraging results with carotenoids (RMSE=3 µg/cm2). Reconstruction of reflectance and transmittance in the 400–2450 nm wavelength domain using PROSPECT is also excellent, with small errors and low to negligible biases. Improvements are particularly noticeable for leaves with low pigment content.}

abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator of crop growth. In this paper, a hybrid inversion method was developed to estimate the LAI values of crops. Based on PROSAIL simulation datasets, 43 hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs), including the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSVAI) and modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2), were analyzed to identify optimal VIs for estimating LAI values. Hybrid inversion models were then built to determine the relationships between optimal simulated VIs and the LAI values (generated by the PROSAIL model) using modeling methods, including curve fitting, artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest regression (RFR) algorithms. Finally, remote sensing mapping of a Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) image was completed using the inversion model to verify the LAI estimation accuracy. The remote sensing mapping of the CHRIS image yielded an accuracy of R2=0.928 and RMSE=0.485 for OSAVI and R2=0.910 and RMSE=0.554 for MTVI2, demonstrating the feasibility of high-accuracy estimation of crop LAI using hyperspectral VIs and a hybrid inversion method. The estimation results of various VIs suggested that the identification of the appropriate VIs is critical to improve the inversion accuracy. In addition, to obtain the appropriate VIs, the factors must be evaluated with respect to two aspects, i.e., the sensitivity to target parameters and the insensitivity to interference. In this study, OSVAI and MTVI2 were sensitive to LAI and relatively insensitive to the effects of interference factors, such as chlorophyll, soil background, sky scattered light and observed geometry. Therefore, these indices could be primarily used as VIs for an LAI estimation. The inversion results of different datasets demonstrated that prior information is critical for improving the inversion accuracy and identifying the optimal VIs. Additionally, based on the comparison of the curve fitting, ANN, and RFR algorithms, RFR was an optimal method for modeling in this study, as indicated by the higher R2 and lower RMSE values for different datasets and various VIs.}

High resolution monitoring of their dynamics will give access to better understanding of processes occurring at different scales, and will be particularly important for ecologists, farmers, and decision makers to assess the influence of climate change on plant functions, and the adaptation of forest, crop, and other plant canopies. In this article, we present a new version of the widely-used PROSPECT model, hereafter named PROSPECT-D for dynamic, which adds anthocyanins to chlorophylls and carotenoids, the two plant pigments in the current version. We describe the evolution and improvements of PROSPECT-D compared to the previous versions, and perform a validation on various experimental datasets. Our results show that PROSPECT-D outperforms all the previous versions. Model prediction uncertainty is decreased and photosynthetic pigments are better retrieved. This is particularly the case for leaf carotenoids, the estimation of which is particularly challenging. PROSPECT-D is also able to simulate realistic leaf optical properties with minimal error in the visible domain, and similar performances to other versions in the near infrared and shortwave infrared domains.}

It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years. However, PROSPECT and SAIL are still evolving: they have undergone recent improvements both at the leaf and the plant levels.

A core challenge for both physics and artificial intelligence (AI) is symbolic regression: finding a symbolic expression that matches data from an unknown function. Although this problem is likely to be NP-hard in principle, functions of practical interest often exhibit symmetries, separability, compositionality, and other simplifying properties. In this spirit, we develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques. We apply it to 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics, and it discovers all of them, while previous publicly available software cracks only 71; for a more difficult physics-based test set, we improve the state-of-the-art success rate from 15 to 90\%.}}

Absorption is modeled using pigment concentration (Ca+b), water content (Cw), and the corresponding specific spectral absorption coefficients (Ka+b and Kw). The parameters n, Ka+b, and Kw have been fitted using experimental data corresponding to a wide range of plant types and status. PROSPECT has been tested successfully on independent data sets.
